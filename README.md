# Battery Test Jig

This repository contains Gerber files and KiCad 7 files for creating a Battery Test Set composed of battery supports and a base board. Together, they allow for various different batteries to be easily connected up to test equipment using Kelvin connections.

The photo below shows the Battery Test Set being used with an AA sized cell, but other sizes are supported too.

NOTE: The Gerber files were generated with EAGLE. 
The KiCad files have not been used to generate Gerber files so far, so there is no guarantee changes are not needed!
If in doubt, use the Gerber files.

NOTE 2: This project is very "revision 1". It could do with improvements, so expect to need to do that. If you do improve it, please submit a merge request so that others can benefit from the improvements too. Many thanks!
