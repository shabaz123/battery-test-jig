# Battery Test Jig

This repository contains KiCad 7 files for creating a Battery Test Set composed of battery supports and a base board. Together, they allow for various different batteries to be easily connected up to test equipment using Kelvin connections.

The photo below shows the Battery Test Set being used with an AA sized cell, but other sizes are supported too.

NOTE: The KiCad files have not been used to generate Gerber files so far.
